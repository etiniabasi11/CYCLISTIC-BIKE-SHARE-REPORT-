# CYCLISTIC-BIKE-SHARE-REPORT-
**Project Description:**  

This project analyzes Cyclisticâ€™s bike-share data to identify differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. Using data from January to November 2024, the analysis explores user behavior, seasonal trends, and bike preferences to inform targeted marketing strategies. Tools like Power BI and Excel were utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Key insights, such as peak usage periods, ride duration, and member distribution, were used to provide actionable recommendations aimed at converting casual riders into annual members and boosting profitability.
